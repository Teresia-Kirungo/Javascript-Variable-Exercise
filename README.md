# Javascript-Variable-Exercise
Given the existing code below, can you write some code so that their values are switched around? <br/>
1. `var a = "3";`
2. `var b = "8";` <br/>
So that the variable `a holds the value "8"`.
And the varaible `b holds the vaue "3"`.
When the code runs, it should output:
```
a is 8
b is 3
```
Do <strong>NOT</strong> change any of the existing code. <br/>
You are NOT allowed to type any numbers.<br/>
You should N redeclare the varaibles `a` and `b`.

Hint: The solution is just 3 lines od code.
